/**
 * @title StakingServiceHooks
 * @author Mate labs
 * @notice Abstract contract providing simplified staking functionality for service contracts
 * @dev This contract provides pre-built hooks for service contracts to easily interact with the EVVM staking system.
 *      It handles the complex 3-step staking process atomically to prevent token loss.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Atomic service staking: Combines prepareServiceStaking, caPay, and confirmServiceStaking in one call
 * - Simplified unstaking for services
 * - Automatic address management for Staking and EVVM contracts
 * - Safe state management to prevent token loss
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Inherit from this contract in your service contract
 * - Call makeStakeService(amount) to stake tokens safely
 * - Call makeUnstakeService(amount) to unstake tokens
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: The service contract must have sufficient Principal Token balance before calling makeStakeService
