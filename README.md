# EVVM Testnet Contracts

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d995ee-7512-42e4-a26c-0d62d2e8e0bf)

EVVM is an innovative blockchain virtualization system that allows you to create and deploy your own virtual blockchains on top of existing Ethereum networks where you can:

- **Create your own virtual blockchain** with custom tokens and governance
- **Deploy on testnets** like Ethereum Sepolia or Arbitrum Sepolia for testing
- **Use proven, audited contracts** for staking, treasury management, and domain services
- **Scale to mainnet** when ready for production

## What's included?

EVVM provides a complete ecosystem of smart contracts:
- **Core EVVM**: Your virtual blockchain's main engine
- **NameService**: Domain name system for your blockchain (like ENS)
- **Staking**: Token staking and rewards system
- **Treasury**: Secure fund management inside the host chain or across chains 
- **Estimator**: Reward calculation and optimization

## Use Cases

This repository serves two main purposes:

### Deploy Your Own EVVM Instance
Create and deploy a complete virtual blockchain with all EVVM contracts on testnets for experimentation and testing.

### Build Services Using Existing EVVM
Use EVVM contracts as a library to build services that interact with already deployed EVVM instances.

## Quick Start Options

Choose your path based on what you want to achieve:

### Option A: Building Services on Existing EVVM 

**Perfect if you want to create smart contracts that interact with already deployed EVVM instances.**

Simply install the library and start building:

```bash
# Install via NPM
npm install @evvm/testnet-contracts

# OR install via Forge  
forge install EVVM-org/Testnet-Contracts
```

**What you get**: Access to all EVVM interfaces and contracts to build services that interact with live EVVM instances on testnets.

**Next steps**: Jump to [Library Usage](#library-usage) section below.

### Option B: Deploy Your Own Complete EVVM Instance

**Perfect if you want to create your own virtual blockchain with custom tokens and governance.**

Follow the complete deployment process:

**What you get**: Your own virtual blockchain with custom tokens, domain system, staking rewards, and treasury management - all deployed and verified on public testnets.

**Next steps**: Jump to [Deploy Your Own EVVM](#deploy-your-own-evvm) section below.

import "@evvm/testnet-contracts/interfaces/IEvvm.sol";
import "@evvm/testnet-contracts/lib/AdvancedStrings.sol";
```

#### Interface-Only Imports (Recommended for DApps)
```solidity
import "@evvm/testnet-contracts/interfaces/IEvvm.sol";
import "@evvm/testnet-contracts/interfaces/IStaking.sol";
```

### Dependencies

#### If using NPM installation
Dependencies are automatically handled when you install the package. However, you need to ensure you have the peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

For cross-chain functionality, you might also need:
```bash
npm install @hyperlane-xyz/core
```

#### If using Forge installation
You need to manually install all dependencies:

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
forge install hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo  # For cross-chain functionality
```

## Repository Structure
- `src/contracts/evvm/` — Core EVVM contracts and storage
- `src/contracts/nameService/` — NameService contracts for domain management
- `src/contracts/staking/` — Staking and Estimator contracts
- `src/contracts/treasury/` — Treasury contract for managing deposits and withdrawals
- `src/lib/` — Shared Solidity libraries (AdvancedStrings, SignatureRecover, etc.)
- `script/` — Deployment and automation scripts (e.g., `DeployTestnet.s.sol`)
- `lib/` — External dependencies (OpenZeppelin, Uniswap v3, forge-std)
- `broadcast/` — Foundry deployment artifacts and transaction history
- `cache/` — Foundry compilation cache
- `input/` — Configuration files for deployment (generated by `evvm-init.sh`)
- `evvm-init.sh` — Interactive setup and deployment script

## Prerequisites
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) (Solidity development toolkit)
- Node.js (if using npm installation method)
- Bash shell (for running `evvm-init.sh`)
- Environment variables set up (`.env` file with API keys and RPC URLs)

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
```bash
RPC_URL_ETH_SEPOLIA=<YOUR_ETH_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL>
RPC_URL_ARB_SEPOLIA=<YOUR_ARB_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL>
ETHERSCAN_API=<YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY>
```

### Security Setup - Import Private Key
Before deploying to testnets, securely import your private key using Foundry:
```bash
cast wallet import defaultKey --interactive
```
This command will prompt you to enter your private key securely. The key will be encrypted and stored locally by Foundry.

> **Note**: `defaultKey` is the default alias used in the makefile and deployment scripts. If you prefer to use a different alias, simply replace `defaultKey` with your chosen name in both the import command and update the corresponding references in the makefile and scripts.

> **Security Note**: Never commit real private keys to version control. Always use the secure wallet import method above for testnet and mainnet deployments.

## Deploy Your Own EVVM

Want to create your own virtual blockchain? Follow these steps to deploy a complete EVVM instance on testnets:

> **What you'll get**: Your own virtual blockchain with custom tokens, domain system, staking rewards, and treasury management - all deployed and verified on public testnets.

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EVVM-org/Testnet-Contracts
cd Testnet-Contracts
make install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create `.env` file with your configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your RPC URLs and API keys
```

### 3. Secure Key Import
```bash
cast wallet import defaultKey --interactive
```

### 4. Interactive Setup & Deploy
```bash
./evvm-init.sh
```

The wizard will configure:
- **Administrator addresses** (admin, golden fisher, activator)
- **EVVM metadata** (name, ID, principal token details)
- **Advanced parameters** (supply, rewards) - optional
- **Network selection** (Ethereum Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, or custom)
- **Automatic deployment** with contract verification

That's it! Your EVVM virtual blockchain is now deployed and verified on your chosen host blockchain.

## Manual Configuration (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control over configuration, create these files in `input/`:

**input/address.json**:
```json
{
  "admin": "0x...",
  "goldenFisher": "0x...",
  "activator": "0x..."
}
```

**input/evvmBasicMetadata.json**:
```json
{
  "EvvmName": "EVVM",
  "EvvmID": 1,
  "principalTokenName": "Mate token",
  "principalTokenSymbol": "MATE"
}
```

**input/evvmAdvancedMetadata.json**:
```json
{
  "totalSupply": 2033333333000000000000000000,
  "eraTokens": 1016666666500000000000000000,
  "reward": 5000000000000000000
}
```

## Local Development & Manual Deployment

### Start Local Development
```bash
make anvil                # Start local blockchain
make deployLocalTestnet   # Deploy to local chain
```

### Manual Deployment to Testnets

If you prefer to deploy manually after configuration:

```bash
# Ethereum Sepolia
make deployTestnet NETWORK=eth

# Arbitrum Sepolia  
make deployTestnet NETWORK=arb

# Custom RPC
forge script script/DeployTestnet.s.sol:DeployTestnet \
    --rpc-url <YOUR_RPC_URL> \
    --account defaultKey \
    --broadcast \
    --verify \
    --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API
```

## Development Commands
```bash
make install     # Install dependencies and compile
make compile     # Recompile contracts
make seeSizes    # Check contract sizes
make help        # Show all available commands
```

## Contract Architecture
The EVVM ecosystem consists of five main contracts:
- **Evvm.sol**: Core virtual machine implementation
- **NameService.sol**: Domain name resolution system  
- **Staking.sol**: Token staking and rewards mechanism
- **Estimator.sol**: Staking rewards estimation and calculation
- **Treasury.sol**: Manages deposits and withdrawals of ETH and ERC20 tokens

## Configuration Files
Key files for EVVM deployment:
- `evvm-init.sh` — Interactive setup wizard
- `input/` — Generated configuration files (address.json, evvmBasicMetadata.json, evvmAdvancedMetadata.json)
- `foundry.toml` — Foundry project configuration
- `makefile` — Build and deployment automation

## Security Best Practices
- **Never commit private keys**: Always use `cast wallet import <YOUR_ALIAS> --interactive` to securely store your keys
- **Use test credentials only**: This repository is for testnet deployment only
- **Environment variables**: Store sensitive data like API keys in `.env` files (not committed to git)
- **Verify contracts**: Always verify your deployed contracts on block explorers
