# EVVM Testnet Contracts

A compact toolkit for creating virtual EVM chains on testnets.

Quick overview
- Use the Solidity packages in `src/` as a library (install via NPM or Forge).
- Use the `evvm` CLI to deploy and manage EVVM instances.

Docs & hosted library: https://www.evvm.info/


Install the library (1 min)

```bash
# NPM (recommended for dApp developers)
npm install @evvm/testnet-contracts

# Or with Forge
forge install EVVM-org/Testnet-Contracts
```

Quick start (2 min)
1) Clone & install
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/EVVM-org/Testnet-Contracts
cd Testnet-Contracts
make install
```

2) Prepare environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit RPC_URL, ETHERSCAN_API, etc.
```

3) Import wallet (secure)
```bash
cast wallet import defaultKey --interactive
```

4) Deploy (interactive)
```bash
# If installed globally:
evvm deploy
# Or from repo:
bun run evvm deploy
```
Quick Start (CLI): https://www.evvm.info/docs/QuickStart

CLI - common commands
- evvm deploy       # deploy EVVM (single or cross-chain)
- evvm register     # register EVVM in registry
- evvm fulltest     # run full test suite
- evvm help         # show CLI help
- evvm version      # CLI version

Library usage (quick)
- NPM: `npm install @evvm/testnet-contracts`
- Forge: `forge install EVVM-org/Testnet-Contracts`
- Import interfaces: `import "@evvm/testnet-contracts/interfaces/IEvvm.sol";`

Troubleshooting (short)
- RPC timeouts: CLI automatically tries fallback RPCs; set `RPC_URL` in `.env` to a reliable endpoint.
- Wallet not found: import with `cast wallet import <name> --interactive`.
- Bun missing: install Bun (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`).
- Tests: run `evvm fulltest` or `forge test`.

Files & structure (short)
- `src/contracts/` — core contracts (Evvm, NameService, Staking, Treasury, P2PSwap)
- `cli/` — TypeScript CLI source
- `script/` — Foundry deployment scripts
- `input/` — optional JSON/Sol files generated by CLI

Security & contributing (short)
- Never commit private keys. Use `cast wallet import`.
- Add tests for new features and open a PR.

If you want, I can further shorten a specific section (CLI, Library, or Troubleshooting).


**Development Flow Context**: This repository is the next step after successful playground testing. It is dedicated to advanced integration, deployment, and validation on public testnets, before mainnet implementation.

### Development Flow
1. **Playground**: Prototype and experiment with new features in the playground repo.
2. **Testnet (this repo)**: Integrate, test, and validate on public testnets.
3. **Mainnet**: After successful testnet validation, proceed to mainnet deployment.

### How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch and make changes
3. Add tests for new features
4. Submit a PR with a detailed description

## Security Best Practices
- **Never commit private keys**: Always use `cast wallet import <YOUR_ALIAS> --interactive` to securely store your keys
- **Use test credentials only**: This repository is for testnet deployment only
- **Environment variables**: Store sensitive data like API keys in `.env` files (not committed to git)
- **Verify contracts**: Always verify your deployed contracts on block explorers
